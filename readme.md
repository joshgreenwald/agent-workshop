# AI Agents Workshop

This code repo is intended to accompany the _AI Agents - A (Probably) Too Philosophical Discussion_ presentation.

It contains the following prompts in the Prompty template format.

- **games.prompty**: creates a list of video game suggestions based on the system and genre
- **sonnet.prompty**: creates a Shakespearean love sonnet
- **icecreamstore.prompty**: suggests a flavor of ice cream based on flavors our simulated ice cream store sells
- **new.prompty** - a blank template for you to fill

## How to run Prompty prompts

1. Open this repo with **Visual Studio Code**.
1. Download the Prompty Visual Studio Code extension
1. Open one of the prompts. On the bottom right, you will see the word "default" to the right of "Prompty". Click on this and then _Add or Edit_ on the command bar at the top of the screen. You will be instructed to initialize a Prompty Visual Studio Code settings config.
1. Set up your connection to OpenAI or Azure OpenAI. You can also use most chat models of your choice. I recommend creating an .env file to keep your connection info.
1. Click on the _Run_ button on the top right of a Prompty prompt to execute the prompt against your connection.
